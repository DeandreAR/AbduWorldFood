				<h3>Who am I ?</h3>
				<p>My name is Abdu, I'm 41 years old and I was born in Tizi Ouzou! After studying tourism, I spent a year in Madrid, where I discovered the "joys of living in the city". On my return, impossible to stay in the country, I decided to settle in Paris, which seems to me at the time, the best option from a professional point of view. The charm of the city of Paris did not have much trouble to work on me, pollution, subway odorous and stressed people, have been my daily life and I really enjoyed!</p>

					<h3>Why this blog ?</h3>
					<p>I like ... good products, the hot baguette that comes out of the oven, organic vegetables that taste like vegetables, beautiful pastries that look like works of art, craftsmen passionate about their craft, eat a loaf of bread. chocolate Sunday morning, put curry in all my dishes, make bricks for my family, put at least three different colors on my plate, discover a flavor never tasted before ... But above all, what I like the most c is CHICKEN !!! Ohhh lalala how I love CHICKEN! But beware, I'm not talking about the damn chicken of KFC and all the other chains of restoration, I speak about the AUTHENTIC, the TRUE DELICE, that of the FOYER DE Vitry.</p>
					<p>That's why I made chicken, my ultimate quest! So, I decided to travel the world, different points of the planet to discover how it was a true work of art was cooked in the world and also other culinary dishes.So I went to various countries, like Japan, India, the United States, Italy to expose my discoveries wriggle and your taste buds!</p>

				<h3>My philosophy</h3>
				<p>Making the decision to go around the world implies that you also need to be aware of what this will mean in terms of change. In my case, I had a CDI, an apartment, furniture, children, a woman but I decided to tackle everything! So I took my Canon EOS 5DS (only professionals know), my big travel bag, my few cents left me and I went on an adventure.In each country I visited, I had to know the best recipes to accompany the chicken and dishes that represented the country's culture.
